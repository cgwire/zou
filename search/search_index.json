Through it, you can link all the tools of your pipeline and make sure they are all synchronized. To integrate it into your tools, you can rely on the dedicated Python client named Gazu . Who is it for? The Kitsu API is made for Technical Directors, ITs, and Software Engineers from animation and VFX studios. With this API, they can enhance the tools they provide to the studio departments. On top of the API, you can deploy the Kitsu frontend, which brings you the full bundle of the collaboration platform developed by CGWire. Features The Kitsu API can: Store production data: projects, shots, assets, tasks, files, metadata, and validations. Store preview files of any kind. Publish an event stream of changes. Provide folder and file paths for any task. Export main data to CSV files. For more details, you can check the full specification . Quickstart (Docker Image) To try Kitsu on your local machine, you can use Docker to run a local instance via this command: Warning: This image is not aimed at production usage. docker run -d -p 80:80 --name cgwire cgwire/cgwire Then you can access the Kitsu API, through http://localhost/api and enjoy the Kitsu web UI at http://localhost . The credentials are: login: admin@example.com password: mysecretpassword Install Hardware prerequisites Users Cores RAM 1-10 2 4 11 - 30 2 8 31 - 80 4 15 81 - 200 8 30 That's the recommended minimum. But it depends on the activity of the production/studio. The size of the files/videos sent The frequency with which files/videos are sent The network speed available between the workstations and the instance. Regarding disk space, you need to allow for a factor of x2.5 x3 of all the files sent (large estimation). It is advisable to separate: The database on another VM PREVIEW_FOLDER directory on a separate volume This simplifies migration/augmentation of volumes. Pre-requisites The installation requires: Ubuntu (version >= 22.04) Python (version >= 3.10) An up-and-running Postgres instance (version >= 9.2) An up-and-running Redis server instance (version >= 2.0) A Nginx instance Setup Dependencies First, let's install third-party software: sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-client postgresql-server-dev-all sudo apt-get install build-essential sudo apt-get install redis-server sudo apt-get install nginx sudo apt-get install xmlsec1 sudo apt-get install ffmpeg NB: We recommend installing Postgres on a separate machine. Install Python 3.12 sudo apt-get install software-properties-common sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa -y sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install python3.12 python3.12-venv python3.12-dev Get sources Create zou user: sudo useradd --home /opt/zou zou sudo mkdir /opt/zou sudo mkdir /opt/zou/backups sudo chown zou: /opt/zou/backups Install Zou and its dependencies: sudo python3.12 -m venv /opt/zou/zouenv sudo /opt/zou/zouenv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip sudo /opt/zou/zouenv/bin/python -m pip install zou Create a folder to store the previews: sudo mkdir /opt/zou/previews sudo chown -R zou:www-data /opt/zou/previews Create a folder to store the temp files: sudo mkdir /opt/zou/tmp sudo chown -R zou:www-data /opt/zou/tmp Prepare database Create Zou database in Postgres: sudo -u postgres psql -c 'create database zoudb;' -U postgres Set a password for your postgres user. For that start the Postgres CLI: sudo -u postgres psql Then set the password ( mysecretpassword if you want to do some tests). psql (9.4.12) Type \"help\" for help. postgres=# \\password postgres Enter new password: Enter it again: Then, exit from the Postgres client console. Alternatively, if you want to set the password to avoid interactive prompts, use: sudo -u postgres psql -U postgres -d postgres -c \"alter user postgres with password 'mysecretpassword';\" SECRET_KEY must be generated randomly (use pwgen 16 command for that). Create the environment variables file for the database: Path: /etc/zou/zou.env DB_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword PREVIEW_FOLDER=/opt/zou/previews TMP_DIR=/opt/zou/tmp SECRET_KEY=yourrandomsecretkey # If you add variables above, add the exports below export DB_PASSWORD SECRET_KEY PREVIEW_FOLDER TMP_DIR SECRET_KEY You need to have these variables in memory when you run a zou command. The easiest way to do this is to run this command: . /etc/zou/zou.env This line is included with every command in the documentation so that you don't forget it. But you don't have to run it every time. Finally, create database tables (it is required to leave the Postgres console and to activate the Zou virtual environment): # Run it in your bash console. . /etc/zou/zou.env /opt/zou/zouenv/bin/zou init-db NB: You can specify a custom username and database. See the configuration section . Prepare the key-value store Currently, Redis requires no extra configuration. To remove warnings in Redis logs and improve background saving success rate, you can add this to /etc/sysctl.conf : vm.overcommit_memory = 1 If you want to do performance tuning, have a look at this article . Set up the indexer (optional) To allow full-text search, Kitsu relies on an Indexing engine. It uses the Meilisearch technology. The indexer is optional. Kitsu can run without it. See Data Indexation Configure Gunicorn Configure the main API server First, create a configuration folder: sudo mkdir /etc/zou We need to run the application through gunicorn , a WSGI server that will run zou as a daemon. Let's write the gunicorn configuration: Path: /etc/zou/gunicorn.py accesslog = \"/opt/zou/logs/gunicorn_access.log\" errorlog = \"/opt/zou/logs/gunicorn_error.log\" workers = 3 worker_class = \"gevent\" Let's create the log folder: sudo mkdir /opt/zou/logs sudo chown zou: /opt/zou/logs Then we daemonize the gunicorn process via Systemd. For that, we add a new file that will add a new daemon to be managed by Systemd: Path: /etc/systemd/system/zou.service [Unit] Description=Gunicorn instance to serve the Zou API After=network.target [Service] User=zou Group=www-data WorkingDirectory=/opt/zou # ffmpeg must be in PATH Environment=\"PATH=/opt/zou/zouenv/bin:/usr/bin\" EnvironmentFile=/etc/zou/zou.env ExecStart=/opt/zou/zouenv/bin/gunicorn -c /etc/zou/gunicorn.py -b 127.0.0.1:5000 zou.app:app [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target Configure Events Stream API server Let's write the gunicorn configuration: Path: /etc/zou/gunicorn-events.py accesslog = \"/opt/zou/logs/gunicorn_events_access.log\" errorlog = \"/opt/zou/logs/gunicorn_events_error.log\" workers = 1 worker_class = \"geventwebsocket.gunicorn.workers.GeventWebSocketWorker\" Then we daemonize the gunicorn process via Systemd: Path: /etc/systemd/system/zou-events.service [Unit] Description=Gunicorn instance to serve the Zou Events API After=network.target [Service] User=zou Group=www-data WorkingDirectory=/opt/zou Environment=\"PATH=/opt/zou/zouenv/bin\" EnvironmentFile=/etc/zou/zou.env ExecStart=/opt/zou/zouenv/bin/gunicorn -c /etc/zou/gunicorn-events.py -b 127.0.0.1:5001 zou.event_stream:app [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target Configure Nginx Finally, we serve the API through a Nginx server. For that, add this configuration file to Nginx to redirect the traffic to the Gunicorn servers: Path: /etc/nginx/sites-available/zou server { listen 80; server_name server_domain_or_IP; location /api { proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_pass http://localhost:5000/; client_max_body_size 500M; proxy_connect_timeout 600s; proxy_send_timeout 600s; proxy_read_timeout 600s; send_timeout 600s; } location /socket.io { proxy_http_version 1.1; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; proxy_set_header Connection \"Upgrade\"; proxy_pass http://localhost:5001; } } NB: We use the 80 port here to make this documentation simpler but the 443 port and https connection are highly recommended. Finally, make sure that the default configuration is removed: sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default We enable that Nginx configuration with this command: sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/zou /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/zou Finally, we can start our daemon and restart Nginx: sudo systemctl enable zou zou-events sudo systemctl start zou zou-events sudo systemctl restart nginx Update Update package First, you have to upgrade the zou package: sudo /opt/zou/zouenv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade zou Update database schema Then, you need to upgrade the database schema: DB_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword /opt/zou/zouenv/bin/zou upgrade-db Restart the Zou service Finally, restart the Zou service: sudo systemctl restart zou zou-events That's it! Your Zou instance is now up to date. NB: Make it sure by getting the API version number from https://myzoudomain.com/api . Deploying Kitsu Kitsu is a javascript UI that allows to manage Zou data from the browser. Deploying Kitsu requires retrieving the built version. For that let's grab it from Github: sudo mkdir -p /opt/kitsu/dist curl -L -o /tmp/kitsu.tgz $(curl -v https://api.github.com/repos/cgwire/kitsu/releases/latest | grep 'browser_download_url.*kitsu-.*.tgz' | cut -d : -f 2,3 | tr -d \\\") sudo tar xvzf /tmp/kitsu.tgz -C /opt/kitsu/dist/ rm /tmp/kitsu.tgz Then we need to adapt the Nginx configuration to allow it to serve it properly: server { listen 80; server_name server_domain_or_IP; location /api { proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_pass http://localhost:5000/; client_max_body_size 500M; proxy_connect_timeout 600s; proxy_send_timeout 600s; proxy_read_timeout 600s; send_timeout 600s; } location /socket.io { proxy_http_version 1.1; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; proxy_set_header Connection \"Upgrade\"; proxy_pass http://localhost:5001; } location / { autoindex on; root /opt/kitsu/dist; try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html; } } Restart your Nginx server: sudo systemctl restart nginx You can now connect directly to your server IP through your browser and enjoy Kitsu! Update Kitsu To update Kitsu, update the files: sudo rm -rf /opt/kitsu/dist sudo mkdir /opt/kitsu/dist curl -L -o /tmp/kitsu.tgz $(curl -v https://api.github.com/repos/cgwire/kitsu/releases/latest | grep 'browser_download_url.*kitsu-.*.tgz' | cut -d : -f 2,3 | tr -d \\\") sudo tar xvzf /tmp/kitsu.tgz -C /opt/kitsu/dist/ rm /tmp/kitsu.tgz Initialise data: Some basic data are required by Kitsu to work properly (like project status) : . /etc/zou/zou.env /opt/zou/zouenv/bin/zou init-data If you have install the indexer, you can also index the data: . /etc/zou/zou.env /opt/zou/zouenv/bin/zou reset-search-index Admin users To start with Zou you need to add an admin user. This user will be able to log in and create other users. For that go into the terminal and run the zou binary: . /etc/zou/zou.env /opt/zou/zouenv/bin/zou create-admin --password 1SecretPass adminemail@yourstudio.com It expects the password as the first argument. Then your user will be created with the email as login, 1SecretPass as password, and \"Super Admin\" as first name and last name. Configuration To run properly, Zou requires a bunch of parameters you can give through environment variables. These variables can be set in your systemd script. All variables are listed in the configuration section . Available actions To know more about what is possible to do with the CGWire API, refer to the API section . Packaging Get the sources, and increment the version located in the zou/__init__.py file. Tag the repository with the new version and run the following commands: pip install wheel twine python setup.py bdist_wheel twine upload dist/<package>.whl NB: It requires access to Pypi CGWire repository.

The generated file name will follow this format: 2021-03-21-zou-db-backup.sql.gz Restoration To restore the database to a new Postgres instance make sure the source and target version of the api match, otherwise the database schema may not match, if all matches run gunzip 2021-03-21-zou-db-backup.sql.gz createdb -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres targetdb psql -h yourphost -p 5432 -U postgres -1 -d targetdb -f 2021-03-21-zou-db-backup.sql you can also just write directly to zoudb (the default database): gunzip 2021-03-21-zou-db-backup.sql.gz psql -h yourphost -p 5432 -U postgres -1 -d zoudb -f 2021-03-21-zou-db-backup.sql when writing to a previously created database, make sure to terminate all the connections to said database by using the following statement: SELECT pg_terminate_backend (pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'zoudb'; you can also change the name of a database to convert it to the default db: ALTER DATABASE targetdb RENAME TO zoudb; you can also change the database being used by using an environment variable in /etc/zou/zou.env DB_DATABASE=targetdb Backup files If you rely on an object storage, you have to check with your provider that your data are properly replicated. If you store your files directly on your drive, you must backup the preview folder ( /opt/zou/previews by default). There are plenty of documentation and tools available on the internet to do that. We won't cover this subject here. Restoration To restore the files you simply have to put the files from your backups the directory you want. Then make sure thate the PREVIEW_FOLDER environment variable targets it properly.","title":"Backup"},{"location":"backup/#backup","text":"It's a good practice to backup your database and your preview files.

Database status Prior to look for logs or any clue about your problem, make sure that the database is up and up to date: . /etc/zou/zou.env /opt/zou/zouenv/bin/zou upgrade-db Error logs Main error logs are stored in the /opt/zou/gunicorn_error.log file. Errors can be explicit. They can tell what is going wrong. Status route To know if all the required services are up, you can connect to the following route: http://kitsu.mystudio.com/api/status . You should see something like this: { \"name\": \"Zou\" \"database-up\": true, \"event-stream-up\": true, \"job-queue-up\": true, \"key-value-store-up\": true, \"version\": \"0.11.3\", } If one of the service is set to false, it means that it is down or that Zou cannot connect to it. Zou cannot run properly in that case. NB: Database refers to Posgres, Key Value Store refers to Redis, Event Stream refers to zou-events service, job queue refers to zou-jobs service. Changing password If, for any reasons, the user cannot access to his rest password email, you can change his password with the following command: . /etc/zou/zou.env /opt/zou/zouenv/bin/zou change-password email@studio.com --password newsecretpassword Installing on Ubuntu server or minimal desktop Zou install will require libjpeg-dev to be installed at the 3rd party software step: sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev To enable zou to start on reboot sudo systemctl enable zou zou-events Job queue Error logs are not displayed in the zou error log files. So you have to check directly the service logs if you look for error messages related to asynchronous jobs (email sending, video normalization and playlist buird). To see the job queue logs, run the following command: journalctl -u zou-jobs.service Postgres connection slots If your Zou server complains by the lack of connection to Postgres available, you can increase the value of BD_POOL_SIZE (default 30) and DB_MAX_OVERFLOW (default 60). They are two environment variables that must be set in your systemd configuration alongside the others. If the problem persists, you can dig into pgpool software. Playlist build failing Unmatching resolutions If your previews have different resolutions, the build will fail. Make sure your playlists have movies with the same size. The build doesn't include pictures, only movies are included. Disk space Check logs and look for: OSError: [Errno 28] No space left on device Make sure it's coherent with what your system tells: df -h du -sh /opt/zou/previews/movies du -sh /opt/zou/previews/files du -sh /opt/zou/previews/pictures The error is explicit: your drive is full. You have multiple options: Add more space Use a s3 compatible service Delete unused files Delete data into Kitsu old projects, old shots or old preview revisions (or both). Create a cronjob that deletes tmp files older than 5 days: # clean kitsu tmp folder 17 2 * * * /usr/bin/find /opt/zou/tmp/ -mtime +5 -exec rm {} \\; Unable to successfully upgrade from a much earlier version If your current working version of Zou is much earlier than the latest version, upgrading directly to the latest may cause problems with the database. This is because occasionally important changes are made to the database during the upgrade process. The solution is to upgrade in smaller steps, making sure you don't miss any critical versions. Since it can be hard to know which version is critical, one option is to apply all updates one after the other. The following script can assist by making updating to a specific version and then incrementing to the next quite easy. Add your database password and edit for any other path differences. Run as <script name> <zou version> eg; ./zou_to_version.sh 0.14.12 . /etc/zou/zou.env sudo /opt/zou/zouenv/bin/python -m pip install 'zou=='$1 #this is the version number variable /opt/zou/zouenv/bin/zou upgrade-db sudo systemctl restart zou zou-events","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#troubleshooting","text":"To solve issues related to your installation, you can do several actions to get information about what is going wrong.","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#database-status","text":"Prior to look for logs or any clue about your problem, make sure that the database is up and up to date: . /etc/zou/zou.env /opt/zou/zouenv/bin/zou upgrade-db","title":"Database status"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#error-logs","text":"Main error logs are stored in the /opt/zou/gunicorn_error.log file.
